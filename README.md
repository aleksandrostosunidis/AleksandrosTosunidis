## About me

I am a positive-thinking person who possesses two sides of power. On one hand, I am organised, structured and attentive to detail due to my background as a Junior QA Manual Engineer & Computer Science Student. And on the other, due to my personality, I love to communicate with people and solve problems.

I am studying for Bachelor's Degree at the Technical University of Sofia - branch Plovdiv. My study field was Intelligent Systems & Artificial Intelligence, which involved OOP & Discret Systems, C++ Programming, etc.

Now, I wish to exploit my experience in software testing. Currently, I am intensively studying techniques and tools by attending online courses and testing web applications created for learning purposes.

I would be extremely happy to apply obtained knowledge to testing an operational product and gain hands-on experience. It is a crucial step in my current career goal â€” to become a mid-level software tester in 2 years.
